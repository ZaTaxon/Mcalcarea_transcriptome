Abstract: Infaunal bivalves are important components of marine soft-bottom ecosystems. In this data article we present the results of transcriptome sequencing of Macoma calcarea (Gmelin, 1791), a common clam species in the Subarctic and Arctic seas. Extracts of total RNA from two individuals from the White Sea were pooled to create a de novo assembly of the transcriptome. Over 9 million high-quality paired-end reads were assembled into 82387 transcripts, of which 27082 candidate protein-coding genes were annotated. We found 936 groups of orthologous genes between M. calcarea and four typical infaunal bivalve species, of which 141 families were single-copy orthologs. Functional annotation of the M. calcarea transcriptome allowed us to find candidate genes potentially involved in contrasting molecular adaptations to subtidal and intertidal habitats. This resource will facilitate adaptive genomic studies of Arctic marine species to test the potential response to climate stresses at various depth ranges.
