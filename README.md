# Mcalcarea_transcriptome
Transcriptome assembly file for Macoma calcarea, peptide fasta files and code for orhologuous genes expansion and contraction analysis

**Data folder** consist of protein fasta files for *Macoma calcarea* and four bivalve reassembled transcriptomes used in the analysis of orthologuous genes.

**calcarea_assembly** folder includes the *de novo* assembly of M.calcarea performed using Trinity v2.8.4 (TSA GIMC00000000) after removal of the remaining adapters and contaminants as suggested by the NCBI TSA piplenine.

**supplementary** - supplementary tables 2 & 3 for the paper in Marine Genomics except for functional annotation

**clams_proteinorto.R** - R script used for the gene family expansion and contraction analysis
